<h2>Explain How The Web Works.</h2>
<h3>The Web is a complex thing, so to explain it we should split it into multiple sections.</h3>

<h3>The definition of the internet:</h3>
<p>The internet is a wire That is burried in the ground,it might be copper or into a cellphone networks but it is a
    wire.
    <br>
    Any two computers connected to this wire can communicate with each other.The server is a special computer connected
    directly
    to the internet. And web pages and files on that server hard drive. <br>
    every server has an unique protocol address or <b>IP address</b>. IP addresses helps computers to find each other.
    <br>
    Computers you and I use everyday are called clients.because they connected indirectly to the Internet through
    internet service provider. <br>
    Whenever an email. Picture or web page travel across the Internet.Computers break the informations into samller
    pieces called <b>packets</b>.When informations reaches it's distenation the packets are resampled in thier original
    order. <br>
    Everything connected directly or indirectly to the Internet has an IP address that includes servers,cellphones,and
    all the equipment in between. <br>
    Anywhere two or more parts of the Internet intersect there is a piece of equipment called <b>a router</b>. Routers
    direct your packets around the Internet helping each packet get one step closer to it's distenation. <br>
    and that's what is the internet. So let's move to the next section. <br>
</p>
<hr>
<h3>URL Gets Resolved:</h3>
<p>
    To get the website code from the severs you enter <b>"Example.com"</b> and it's called <b>"domain"</b>. <br>
    So to clarify it your browser sends a request to the server with IP address by using the domain. <br>
    To translate domain to ip address there it typer of servers called <b>DNS server</b>. <br>
    Now let's have a look at the next section.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Request Is Sent:</h3>
<p>
    The browser group some informations and sends that package to the IP address. <br>
    The data is sent via <b>"HyperText Transfer Protocol"</b> called as <b>HTTP</b> too.a normalized protocol which
    defines what a request (and response) has to look like <br>
    When all of process is normalized,The server handles the request appropriately and returns a so called response.So
    basically the request is a response but in the opposite direction. <br>
    The response will contain the code that will be rendered onto the screen. <br>
    That response doesn't have to contain "a website". It can contain any data - including files or images. <br>
    That move us to next section.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Response Is Parsed:</h3>
<p>
    Referencing the above. The server sends the html data and the browser builds it based on that. <br>
    The HTML does not contain how the page should be styled.It really only defines the structure and tells the browser
    which content is a heading, which content is an image, which content is a paragraph etc. <br>
    It's like a skeleton right?. <br>
    That's why we should use another programming language. which isn't a "REAL programming language" it's called <b>CSS
        or "Cascading Style Sheets"</b>. <br>
    So it's like a skeleton "HTML" and Skin "CSS"

</p>
<hr>
<p>to summarize,The internet is a wire that contains addresses called ip addresses connected with computers that send and
    recive web pages that built by html and css.</p>
