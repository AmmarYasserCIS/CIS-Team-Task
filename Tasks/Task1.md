<h3>The definition of the internet:</h3>
<p>The internet is a wire That is burried in the ground,it might be copper or into a cellphone networks but it is a
    wire.
    <br>
    Any two computers connected to this wire can communicate with each other.The server is a special computer connected
    directly
    to the internet. And web pages and files on that server hard drive. <br>
    every server has an unique protocol address or <b>IP address</b>. IP addresses helps computers to find each other.
    <br>
    Computers you and I use everyday are called clients.because they connected indirectly to the Internet through
    internet service provider. <br>
    Whenever an email. Picture or web page travel across the Internet.Computers break the informations into samller
    pieces called <b>packets</b>.When informations reaches it's distenation the packets are resampled in thier original
    order. <br>
    Everything connected directly or indirectly to the Internet has an IP address that includes servers,cellphones,and
    all the equipment in between. <br>
    Anywhere two or more parts of the Internet intersect there is a piece of equipment called <b>a router</b>. Routers
    direct your packets around the Internet helping each packet get one step closer to it's distenation. <br>
    and that's what is the internet. So let's move to the next section. <br>
